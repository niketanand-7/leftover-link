# Leftover Link üç£

Leftover Link is a full-stack application with a mission to bridge the gap between local restaurants and homeless shelters, facilitating the donation of unused food before it goes to waste. Our primary goal is to provide fresh and nutritious meals to those in need while reducing food waste in our communities. This repository contains the source code and documentation for both the client-side (front-end) and server-side (back-end) modules of the Leftover Link application.

## Features

- Connect restaurants with homeless shelters for food donations.
- User-friendly and intuitive interface for easy navigation and interaction.
- Display restaurants and donation locations using Google Maps integration.
- Create, read, update, and delete operations for restaurants and food items.
- Seamless communication between restaurants and shelters through the platform.
- Reliable and efficient RESTful APIs for data management.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: Used for building the front-end of the application, providing a responsive and interactive user interface.
- Express.js and Node.js: Utilized for building the back-end of the application, handling requests, and managing data flow.
- MongoDB/Mongoose: Chosen for data persistence and schema creation, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of information.
- Google Maps API: Integrated to display restaurants and donation locations on an interactive map.
- Postman: Employed for testing the RESTful APIs to ensure reliability and functionality.



We appreciate your interest in making a difference in the sustainability climate and helping us address food waste and hunger in our communities. Thank you for joining us on this mission! Together, one meal at a time, we can make a difference.
